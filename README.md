This project's login, data collection and data display parts are based on a Node.js Server written by myself. You can find it in the folder of NodejsServer located at this level. 

Besides, you also need to get a MongoDB in your computer to run the server.

It is a Unity + Unity Shader + Nodejs + MongoDB Project.

If you are interested in running my project, you may need to copy the script in it and reconstruct it at local. I only tested it at local, but I believe if you change some codes of relative scripts, you can run it based on internet.
